# Phoenix Static Buildpack

## Purpose

This buildpack is meant to be used with the [Heroku Buildpack for Elixir](https://github.com/HashNuke/heroku-buildpack-elixir). When deploying Phoenix apps to Heroku, static assets will need to be compiled. This buildpack sees to it that static assets are compiled and that a corresponding asset manifest is generated.

## Features
* Easily customizable to your build needs with its `compile` hook!
* Works much like the [Heroku Buildpack for Elixir](https://github.com/HashNuke/heroku-buildpack-elixir)!
* **Easy configuration** with `phoenix_static_buildpack.config` file
* Automatically sets `DATABASE_URL`
* If your app doesn't have a Procfile, default web task `mix phx.server` will be run
* Can configure versions for Node and NPM
* Auto-installs Bower deps if `bower.json` is in your app's root path
* Caches Node, NPM modules and Bower components

## Usage

```bash
# Create a Heroku instance for your project
heroku apps:create my_heroku_app

# Set and add the buildpacks for your Heroku app
heroku buildpacks:set https://github.com/HashNuke/heroku-buildpack-elixir
heroku buildpacks:add https://github.com/gjaldon/heroku-buildpack-phoenix-static

# Deploy
git push heroku master
```

### Serve with Sass assets

If your project serves Sass assets, you need the sass binary for `sass-brunch` via ruby buildpack.

Create a `Gemfile` to include the `sass` gem:
```
source 'https://rubygems.org'
ruby '2.3.1'
gem 'sass'
```

Then run generate the `Gemfile.lock`:
```bash
bundle install
```

Finally, add the ruby buildpack.
```bash
# Add the ruby buildpack to your Heroku app
heroku buildpacks:add https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-ruby
```

## Configuration

Create a `phoenix_static_buildpack.config` file in your app's root dir if you want to override the defaults. The file's syntax is bash.

If you don't specify a config option, then the default option from the buildpack's [`phoenix_static_buildpack.config`](https://github.com/gjaldon/heroku-buildpack-phoenix-static/blob/master/phoenix_static_buildpack.config) file will be used.


__Here's a full config file with all available options:__

```bash
# Clean out cache contents from previous deploys
clean_cache=false

# We can change the filename for the compile script with this option
compile="compile"

# We can set the version of Node to use for the app here
node_version=5.3.0

# We can set the version of NPM to use for the app here
npm_version=2.10.1

# We can set the version of Yarn to use for the app here
yarn_version=1.13.0

# We can set the path to phoenix app. E.g. apps/phoenix_app when in umbrella.
phoenix_relative_path=.

# Remove node and node_modules directory to keep slug size down if it is not needed.
remove_node=false

# We can change path that npm dependencies are in relation to phoenix app. E.g. assets for phoenix 1.3 support.
assets_path=.

# We can change phoenix mix namespace tasks. E.g. `phoenix` for phoenix < 1.3 support.
phoenix_ex=phx
```

### Heroku CI

Additionally, you can create a `phoenix_static_buildpack.test.config` file that is specific for Heroku CI runs. Once defined, it will override the `phoenix_static_buildpack.config` values.

## Compile

By default, Phoenix uses `brunch` and recommends you to use `mix phx.digest` in production. For that, we have a default `compile` shell script which gets run after building dependencies and
just before finalizing the build. The `compile` file [looks like this](https://github.com/gjaldon/heroku-buildpack-phoenix-static/blob/master/compile).

To customize your app's compile hook, just add a `compile` file to your app's root directory.
`compile` is just a shell script, so you can use any valid `bash` code. Keep in mind you'll have
access to your `node_modules` and `mix`. This means that if you're using a Node build tool other than `brunch`, you can just do something like:

```bash
# app_root/compile
cd $phoenix_dir
npm --prefix ./assets run build
mix "${phoenix_ex}.digest" #use the ${phoenix_ex} variable instead of hardcoding phx or phoenix
```

The above `compile` overrides the default one. :)


## FAQ

1. When to use?
- This buildpack is only necessary when you need to compile static assets during deploys. You will not need this buildpack if you are using Phoenix only as a REST API.

2. Do I need `heroku-buildpack-nodejs` with this?
- No, this buildpack installs Node for you. How it differs from the NodeJS buildpack
is that it adds `mix` to the PATH so you can run `mix` commands like `mix phx.digest`.

3. I am getting an error `Command "deploy" not found.` even though my previous deploys used to work. How to fix?
- The default `compile` file, which are a set of commands ran during the buildpack's compile hook, was replaced to be compatible with Phoenix versions 1.4 and above. If using brunch and older versions of Phoenix, you will need to add a custom `compile` in your app's root directory that looks like:

```bash
brunch build --production

cd $phoenix_dir

mix "${phoenix_ex}.digest"

if mix help "${phoenix_ex}.digest.clean" 1>/dev/null 2>&1; then
  mix "${phoenix_ex}.digest.clean"
fi
```
